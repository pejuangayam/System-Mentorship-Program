The MentorshipApp System is a web based platform designed to manage a student mentorship program efficiently. The system connects mentors, mentees and administrators in one application.

Mentors can create meetings, provide guidance and add notes or exercises for their assigned mentees. Each mentor is required to select a profession, with a maximum of three professions allowed per mentor. Mentees can attend scheduled meetings and access notes provided by their mentors.

Administrators are responsible for managing mentor and mentee accounts, as well as maintaining profession information to ensure the system operates smoothly. This system helps improve communication, organization, and knowledge sharing within the mentorship program.
